# AOC21
I'll try to solve AOC21 without extra libraries like numpy.
Clean Code and Big O Notation are completely disregarded. ;)

##Libraries I allow myself to use from the python standard-libraries:
```
 - re (regex)
 - sys (syscalls, to make import life easier)
```

## requirements
```
# required
None

# optional
pip install advent-of-code-data # for an automatic data request
```
